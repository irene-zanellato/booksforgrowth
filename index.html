            <h1>About ME</h1>
            <p>
              I am a Business and Management student with a broad interest in Real Estate and Personal Development. I'm always looking for further ways to improve myself and better every aspect of my life. I am literally addicted to books! I consider them a wonderful way to acquire new knowledge and gain a different perspective on the world (or a specific topic), as you can see through the author’s eyes… and heart. For this reason, I decided to create BooksForGrowth, a blog in which I'll be sharing some insights about books I found particularly interesting and insightful... <br>
              I dedicated to each of my interests one specific section of the blog. <br>
              In the first section, I'll share with you several books about Real Estate. Here I'll cover a variety of topics, such as investing passively, managing rental properties, getting the right kind of financing, and so on. <br>
              In the second section, I'll focus on Personal Development, as I firmly believe that you cannot succed financially if you are not in alignment with yourself first.
